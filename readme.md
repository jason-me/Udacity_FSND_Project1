# Project: Movie Trailer Website  - **Jason's Fried Tomatoes Movie Trailers** by Jason M. Hester
==============================

## Required Libraries and Dependencies
-----------------------------------
All you need is Python 2.7 and access to a default system browser (e.g. FireFox, Safari, etc.); the webbrowser module is contained within.

## How to Run Project
------------------
1. Download the .zip file and extract it in a folder of your choosing.
2. Launch a terminal window (MacOS, Linux) or comand prompt (Windows) then navigate to the directory path that includes the extracted folder.
3. In MacOS or Linux use the command ```python entertainment_center.py``` to run the program. In Windows use ```entertainment_center.py``` 

## Description
-----------
This project will open a new browser window displaying a set of my favorite 6 movies with their poster, title, storyline, and rating. Clicking on any of the poster tiles will open a modal window that plays the trailer from you tube. 

### Accessibility
-------------
I have also pulled in some alt-text for screen-reader users, but unfortunately the default HTML, CSS, and Javascript included in the fresh_tomatoes file requires much more time than this project allows to make fully keyboard accessible and actionable with onkey event handlers, etc. I hope to spend more time after this course is finished making these project files accessible and compliant with WCAG 2.0 and encourage the course managers to review these suppplied materials for accessibility in the future.
